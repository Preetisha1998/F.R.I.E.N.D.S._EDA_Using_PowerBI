# F.R.I.E.N.D.S._EDA_Using_PowerBI

F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is an American television sitcom (situational comedy), that aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. The show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City and has 236 episodes, over a course of 10 yrs.

Our 6 famous characters are Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Joey Tribbiani (Matt Le Blanc) and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). They  go through just about every life experience imaginable together; love, marriage, divorce, children, heartbreaks, fights, new jobs and job losses and all sorts of drama.

## Power BI

Microsoft Power BI is a business Intelligence (BI) platform that provides nontechnical business users with tools for aggregating, analyzing, visualizing and sharing data.  Power BI can help connect disparate data sets, transform and clean the data into a data model and create charts or graphs to provide visuals of the data. All of this can be shared with other Power BI users within the organization.

I used Power BI instead of python here as visualization is much more easy, interactive and fun in Power BI.


I also wrote my first ever blog, explaining the visualization steps.
